# klang
worlds best new compiled language

## why?
i was bored one day

## why python?
mainly because of the usage of SLY and instead of recoding the whole language in C++ with LLVM im just going to use llvmlite

### TODO:
* [ ] Finish compiler
  * [ ] Add loops (only conditional while loops)
  * [ ] Add `+, -. *. /` Operators
  * [ ] Add `+=, -=. *=. /=, ++, --` Operators
  * [ ] Add arrays
  * [ ] Add if statements
  * [ ] Add macros
  * [ ] Finish imports (function calls are broken)
  * [ ] Reimplement most of old language features from original
